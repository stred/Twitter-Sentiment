# Twitter-Sentiment
This R program was created to help with a college project.

I pulled some bit together from some pieces given to me by my lecturer then traced them back to the original source and enhanced a bit to suit my own purposes.

I hope that you find it useful.

There are 3 sections that you need to work with.

STEP 1 - This should only really need to be run once, ever, on any system - it loads the libraries that are needed

STEP 2 - This can be run in a new session. It sets up variables and logs into Twitter using oAuth.

STEP 3 - This can be run as many times as you need. Set the search terms that you need to look for and the code will do the rest.
